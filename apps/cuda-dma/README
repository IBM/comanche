gdrcpy
-------------

Gdrcopy is built during make bootstrap, but to run the application you need to install the corresponding kernel module(one time):
```
Comancheroot/src/deps/gdrcopy/insmod.sh
```

# Block device performance test using optionally shared polling thread.  Client threads
# only access a single device.
#
./block-perf  --pci 11:00.0 --pci 8b:00.0 --pci 86:00.0 --iothreads 1
